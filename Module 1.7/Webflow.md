# WEBFLOW

## Introduction

This tool is used to create web pages, without writting code.

## The webflow Interface

1st panel, it has different sections, blocks, layouts, grids, etc. we can drag them to the main page. 

2nd panel, assembles, in case we want to keep any block in throuigh pages then we ca use aassembles

3rd panel, navigator, we can see what we have in the web site. 

4th panel, pages here we can see all pages that we have created

5th panel, CMS, WE CAN UPLOAD TEMPLATES HERE.

6th panel, assets, here we hold all icons, images, videos useful in the web page.

In the top we have some functions that let us see the web page as if we were using different devices (responsive page). We can suit it to the screen size. 

We can also export code, this will export it using the classic HTML and css. This is used in cases where w want to use the design in WordPress. 

In the right panel we can make styling changes, such as-, fonts, colors, margin, padding, etc. 
- margin adds space outside the compnent, padding adds space into the component.
