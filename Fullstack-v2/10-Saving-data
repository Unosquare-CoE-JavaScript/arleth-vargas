## Files and Databases overview

We mostrly write save and get data from databases. 
Filws are not portable, this can be stored in one serve  and it NOT SCALABLE. 

Databases is readable and writable, when we talk of a lot of data we need this ti be organized. 

## Relational DB

- sql
- TYablws
- - Relarted data
- - Strict structure

This describes how entities are relarted to each otherit has its own language and when yoy have large ammounts of sdata you need this. 

We need a schema which is a strict rule, and we have to make sure that eg one field is only for ione type, eg. boolean,

## NON R elational DB

- NoSql
- Data agnostic
- loos structure

And when we think of pure document storage w can use this one.  They are data agnostic they fdont care about the data you are entering there. 

## Redis

this stores a key and a  value it is nonrelational db and we can also use node redis.

## Web Sockets

it is two way ot is a persistent bidirectional connection nebetween client and server. It is used in chat appliction in case we want to keep the connection open.
